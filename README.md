This repository is a collection of data analysis projects applied to the challenges of Corporate Sustainability, ESG, Risk, and Compliance. The objective is to demonstrate how data science can be used to transform good intentions into actionable strategies and measurable results.

My work focuses on translating raw data into insights that support decision-making, promoting innovation and business resilience.
