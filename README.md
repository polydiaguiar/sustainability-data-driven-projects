# ðŸŒ± Data-Driven Sustainability Projects

## | Introduction

This repository is a collection of data analysis projects applied to the challenges of Corporate Sustainability, ESG, Risk, and Compliance. The objective is to demonstrate how data science can be used to transform good intentions into actionable strategies and measurable results.

My work focuses on bridging the gap between ambitious goals and tangible outcomes. I transform raw data into clear, actionable insights that empower strategic decision-making, drive innovation, and build business resilience. The ultimate goal is to convert good intentions into measurable results.
