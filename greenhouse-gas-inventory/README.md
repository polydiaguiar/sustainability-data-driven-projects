# Corporate GHG Emissions Inventory: EcoLogística S.A.

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Inventory for **EcoLogística S.A.**, a fictitious mid-sized logistics company operating in Brazil. The goal is to calculate the emissions for the fiscal year 2024, identifying major emission hotspots and establishing a baseline for future decarbonization strategies.

This repository contains:

* **Raw Data & Calculation Log:** Full Excel spreadsheet with open formulas.
* **Executive Report:** A summary of findings and strategic recommendations.
* **Dashboard:** Visual representation of the emissions breakdown.

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

The inventory follows the **Operational Control** approach, covering 100% of the emissions from operations where the company has full authority to introduce and implement operating policies.


* **Reporting Period:** January 1st, 2024 – December 31st, 2024.
* **Organizational Boundary:**
     * Headquarters (Admin): Office activities.
     * Distribution Center (CD): Logistics and storage operations.
     * Logistics Fleet: 5 heavy-duty trucks owned by the company.

## 3. Methodology & Standards
The calculations follow the **GHG Protocol Corporate Standard** and the **Brazilian GHG Protocol Program** specifications.

* **Scope 1 (Direct Emissions):** Mobile combustion (Fleet/Diesel B14), Stationary combustion (Forklifts/Natural Gas), and Fugitive emissions (HVAC/Refrigerant Gases).
* **Scope 2 (Indirect Emissions):** Purchased electricity from the National Grid (SIN - Sistema Interligado Nacional).
* **Global Warming Potentials (GWP):** Based on the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

## 4. Key Findings (Summary)

* **Total Emissions:** XX $tCO_2e$.
* **Scope Breakdown:** Scope 1 accounts for **X%** of total emissions, driven primarily by the diesel fleet.
* **Carbon Intensity:** X $tCO_2e$ per km driven (or per unit of revenue).

## 5. Tools & Data Sources
* **Tools:** Microsoft Excel (Advanced Modeling) and ferramenta_ghg_protocol_v2025.0.1.
* **Emission Factors:**
    * **Fuels:** Brazilian GHG Protocol Calculation Tool (v2024).**
    * **Electricity:** MCTI (Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation) average grid factors.**
    * **Refrigerants:** IPCC AR5 / DEFRA.**
