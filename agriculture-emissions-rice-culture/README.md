## ðŸŒ¾ **Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Rice Cultivation: A Comparative Analysis with a Focus on Brazil**

### | **Objective**

This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of greenhouse gas emissions originating from rice cultivation, focusing on a selection of the world's top producers: **China (CHN), India (IND), Bangladesh (BGD), Indonesia (IDN), Vietnam (VNM), Thailand (THA), Myanmar (MMR), and the Philippines (PHL)**.

The core of the analysis is a comparative study, drawing a detailed parallel between the emission trajectories of these leading nations and **Brazil (BRA)**. The goal is to benchmark Brazil's performance, understand its position in the global context, and investigate the correlation between emission trends and documented agricultural practices.

#### | **Key Research Questions**

This analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

* **Emission Evolution:** How have GHG emissions from rice farming evolved over the years for each of the top-producing countries?
* **Brazil's Benchmark:** How does Brazil's emission trajectory compare to the other major producers? Is it following, leading, or lagging behind global trends?
* **Practices and Policies:** What correlations can be found between emission reduction trends and the documented agricultural policies or mitigation practices implemented in these nations?
* **Actionable Insights:** What successful strategies from other countries could potentially be applied in Brazil to reduce its emissions footprint from rice cultivation? What lessons can be learned from countries where emissions have not decreased?

#### | **Methodology**
The project was conducted using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to clean, process, and visualize the dataset. The quantitative findings were supplemented with qualitative research into the agricultural policies and sustainability initiatives of the selected countries to provide context to the observed trends.
